Please organise your own accomodation for the week. The hackathon will take place in the Met Office collaboration building which is on the opposite (east) side of the M5 to Met Office HQ and part of the Exeter Science Park. The collaboration building is approximately a 20 min walk from Met Office HQ so staying at the Holiday Inn or Premier Inn (both of which are next to Met Office HQ is one option). Alternatively there is a new hotel at the Exeter Science Park, Voco Zeal, which is approx. 5 min walk from the collaboration building. Some may want to make use of the multiple hotel options in Exeter City Centre, the 4A bus from the city centre goes to/from the science park but allow additional time during the morning and evening rush hour.
