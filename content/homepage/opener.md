The 2026 UK km-scale hackathon will take place at the **Met Office Collaboration Building, Exeter**, on **18-22 May 2026**. A hierarchy of km-scale **Met Office Unified Model simulations**, from regional to global, will enable analysis of atmospheric phenomena over convective to planetary scales. It is part of the **World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)** effort to push the boundaries of climate system modelling and digital innovation.

The event is partly sponsored by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and lead organiser for the UK node of the hackathon is Pier Luigi Vidale from NCAS Reading.
