<h2 id="what-is-a-nextgems-hackathon">What is a nextGEMS hackathon?</h2>
<p>nextGEMS is an European project that follows a new approach to climate modelling with global storm-resolving Earth-system Models. The project members meet regularly at hackathons to collaboratively analyse the latest model runs, exchange ideas and develop new ways forward.</p>
<p>We would like to include universities and research groups, especially from regions with less of a tradition in climate science. External participants applying for a stipend will (mostly) be organized in teams to work on an Application Challenge Problem associated with the main hackathon themes: fire weather, (urban) heat extremes, and precipitation extremes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you haven’t been to a hackathon, have a look at our <a href="https://nextgems-h2020.eu/hackathon/">previous hackathons</a> to get an impression of the atmosphere during our previous meetings.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply?</h2>

<li>The application shall be supported by a supervisor.</li>
